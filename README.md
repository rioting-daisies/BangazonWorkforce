Welcome to the Bangazon Workforce internal application for our human resources and IT departments. The application will allow them to create, list, and view Employees, Training Programs, Departments, and Computers.

1. A computer
1. A brain

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. Make sure your computer is turned on, if not, power it on by hitting the power button. (If you have trouble, contact the IT department)
1. Make yourself a cup of coffee to ensure the highest level of focus (don't spill it on your computer, if you do, PANIC and contact IT department)
1. Open up git bash / terminal and clone down the repository onto your local machine
1. Count to 10 and spin around your chair 3 times before you get to 10 (very important)
1. Open the BangazonWorkforce directory in Visual Studio
1. Locate the BangazonAPI.sql file in the project

1. Head back on over to Visual Studio and Run the application (make sure the BangazonWorkforce server is selected)
